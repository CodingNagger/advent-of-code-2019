# Advent of Code 2019

While you're here you may even have a look at [my blog post about the event](https://www.codingnagger.com/2019/12/02/advent-of-code-2019-game-on/).

Just my advent of code solutions, hopefully I'll motivate myself to get beyond day 8 this year. Putting code out there because it looks like literally everyone is doing it so have fun browsing through the most average code you'll ever see.

P.S. the challenge is a lie, I was forced to do math from day 3. People using python and all its freebie math functions are basically cheating #SaltLife.
